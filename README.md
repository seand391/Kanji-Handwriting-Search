## Description

Kanji Handwriting Search is a website that Japanese learners can use to easily search for the meaning of unfamiliar  
kanji combinations with no extra steps. Users simply draw the kanji in the box and the site will present them several  
guesses to what they are drawing. Once they select the kanji from that list, it is added to the search bar and they  
can either search for it or draw more. When all the kanji have been entered, clicking search will redirect you to  
the dictionary that everyone already knows and loves, Jisho.

## Background

This is a personal project that I designed to solve a problem I frequently had while I was learning Japanese.  
I would often come across kanji that I did not recognize and had to look up the meaning of, but lacked a convenient  
tool to do so. There were a few different options that I always found myself going between, but none of them were  
consistently what I needed.  
The site that I used most frequently was [kanji.sljfaq.org](https://kanji.sljfaq.org/) because I found that had the most reliable
character recognition algorithm. The only problem was that it only allowed you to search for one kanji at a time.
This meant that if you wanted to find the meaning of a word comprised of multiple kanji, you had to search each
individual one, and then copy them all into a dictionary site to find the meaning.  
That brings me to the next option, [jisho.org](https://jisho.org/). Jisho is an excellent english to japanese dictionary, and it  
even has a feature to search kanji by drawing built into the site. The only problem is that the algorithm is really  
inconsistent and often doesn't even come close to the kanji you are trying to search for. The last option that I  
used was called Yomiwa, which had a great algorithm with multi-kanji search and a built in dictionary, but it is only  
available as a mobile app and not a desktop website, so sometimes it wasn't what I was looking for.  
This led me to design a solution that combines the best of all the above options, leaving behind the worst. Kanji
Handwriting Search is a site that serves the sole purpose of allowing the user to hand-draw kanji and add as many  
as they want to the search bar, and then click search to get the definition on Jisho. This combination of a good
recognition algorithm, the ability to search multiple kanji at once, and the extensive data available on Jisho make  
this the tool that any Japanese learner dreams of.
